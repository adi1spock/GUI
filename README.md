## intro
i have added a desktop GUI using python tkinter module on top of the neural style transfer developed using tensorflow by @ jcjhonson. i have used the algorithm that does the neural style transfer on videos
and have made simple and elegant GUI where u can easily select the image of which style transfer u want to do on video feed taken by your desktop web cam.
